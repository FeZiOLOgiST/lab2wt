        <p>With the imminent completion of the Empire's Death Star, the Rebel Alliance anticipated a major Imperial offensive. To unify command and coordinate a defense, the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Independence carried members of the Alliance High Command to their secret base on Yavin 4. Upon arrival, the Independence sent Red, Gold and Blue Squadron to the Yavin Base. Their numbers were augmented by veteran pilots as the Alliance gathered its resources in preparation for the coming battle.

            The Rebels' Operation Skyhook had resulted in the resistance movement obtaining a complete technical readout of the battle station. The plans were placed into the hands of Rebel leader Princess Leia Organa, but she was captured by Imperial forces over the planet Tatooine.

            The plans were brought to Yavin 4 after the crew and passengers of the Millennium Falcon successfully rescued Organa from the Death Star. To facilitate their escape, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi had confronted his former Padawan and Organa's father, Darth Vader, and sacrificed himself in the process.

        <p>The Inheritance Exemption was a document signed by the Ten merchant families that controlled the Kuat Drive Yards. Its purpose was to resolve internal conflicts between the families, thus allowing them to concentrate on their business affairs. The document granted permanent control of the starship manufacturing facilities to the long respected Kuat family. Every generation, a member of the family would be chosen to manage the company to the profit of all the Kuati ruling families.

        <p> The tension between Chancellor Palpatine and the Jedi Order grew as the Council         became increasingly wary of the Chancellor's lust for greater power. As the             Chancellor continued to increase his authority through a variety of emergency           powers, the Council became ever more suspicious of Palpatine's intentions and           ultimately disapproved of the Republic's gradual slide into autocracy, especially at     the expense of the Senate-the only governmental body that the Order was legally         obligated to serve.

            With the help of Anakin Skywalker, the Council discovered that Palpatine was actually the elusive Darth Sidious, Dark Lord of the Sith, and thus they conspired to arrest the Republic's own head of state. The Jedi coup d'etat ended in failure, however, when Palpatine killed all four of the Jedi Masters, including Mace Windu, that tried to take him into custody. He then responded by declaring all Jedi as enemies of the Republic and won the Senate's support after portraying them as assassins bent on taking over the Republic. Through Order 66, the Chancellor realized the Sith's long-awaited dream of the Jedi Order's destruction. Without warning, the clone troopers of the Grand Army betrayed and murdered most of their Jedi officers.
