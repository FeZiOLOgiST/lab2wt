            <p>The Executor-class Star Dreadnought, colloquially known as the Executor-class Super Star Destroyer, Executor-class Star Destroyer or simply Super Star Destroyer, was a heavy warship class in the Star Dreadnought league, often used as command ships and flagships in the Imperial Navy. At their prime, they were among the largest vessels in the galaxy, and were almost invincible in combat, although they were costly to operate.</p>

            <p>The Imperial-class Star Destroyer bristled with weapons emplacements. 60 Taim & Bak XX-9 heavy turbolaser batteries, 60 Borstel NK-7 ion cannons, and 10 Phylon 07 tractor beam projectors dotted its whitish gray hull. At the very front of the ship existed the forward pursuit tractor beam array. The ship also featured six dual heavy turbolaser turrets, two quad heavy turbolasers, three triple medium turbolasers, and two medium turbolasers. The Imperial I-class also featured two dual heavy ion cannon turrets that lined the dorsal superstructure flanking the command tower.</p>

            <p>The most prominent weapons on the second Star Destroyer model that appears in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi are eight barbette mountings, each mounting eight gun-barrels, which are arranged in rows of four on either side of the superstructure. They replace the heavy turbolasers and heavy ion cannons on the ISD-I.

                Numerous Expanded Universe sources cite the armament of the Imperial II as consisting of 50 turbolasers, heavy turbolasers or turbolaser batteries, and ion cannons.

            <p>The Death Star, known officially as the DS-1 Orbital Battle Station, or the Ultimate Weapon in early development stages, and later referred to as the Death Star I and the First Death Star, was a moon-sized, deep-space mobile battle station constructed by the Galactic Empire. Designed to fire a single planet-destroying superlaser powered by massive kyber crystals, it was the pet project of Emperor Palpatine, Director Orson Callan Krennic, and its eventual commander Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin to expound the military philosophy of the aptly named Tarkin Doctrine.

        <p>The Battle of Endor, fought between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire in 4 ABY, was one of the largest and most important engagements of the Galactic Civil War. It signified the decline of the Empire, with the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader, as well as many major Imperial leaders, and the destruction of the Death Star II.
